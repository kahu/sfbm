#Stupid file browser menu.

SFBM is a simple file browser in the form of a menu. That's probably not a good idea, but who cares?
It is somewhat similar to [Gnome menu file browser applet.](http://code.google.com/p/gnome-menu-file-browser-applet/)

Features:
* Browse the local file system.
* Open files by **clicking** on them. (!)
* Open a directory in your file manager by **middle-clicking** on the folder, or a file in it.
* Or do the same thing by **double-clicking** on a folder.
* **Drag and drop** from the menu, but not to it.
* A mostly useless context menu. **Right-click**
